# gnotes_in_cli
a simple Python script that prints contents of Gnome Notes

It uses:
listdir from os
isfile, join from os.path
minidom from xml.dom

# A sample use case
I've created it so I could add contents of my notes inside Conky, so now I can have reminders and notes there, alongside fancy clock and resource usage on my 2nd monitor.

Possibly better ways to do this, but it seemed nice exercise for a begginer :) .
